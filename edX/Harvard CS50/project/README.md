CS50 Final Project - Message!
Web-based Application developed by Ray

Runtime requirements
Python
pytz library downloaded from Google
Flask library
Compatible browser to view (Tested in Google Chrome and iPhone Safari, both seems to work fine)

This is a web-based application that does the following

1. Allows texting through web
2. People can have the ability to view what everyone is saying
3. Upon refresh, the messages in the database is retrieved
4. Clears the message everyday at 00:00, UTC +08:00 time, or simply Chinese time
5. Logs the time that each user texts
6. Prevents people from spamming the chat, 60 characters maximum in message
7. Adapts to different screen sizes

What you have to do is simply run the project as "Flask run", then connect to your webpage

Congratulations!
Now you have a fully functioning message application!
