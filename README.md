# Online-Course
This is the place where I'll upload all of my assignments and quizzes that I've completed online. 

This repository will record all courses and course materials that I have completed online and obtained some skills for. 
I hope this repository can be used to aid anyone who's struggling with these courses. 

However, please **do not use this repository for anything that is against any academic integrity codes**.
